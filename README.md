I'm a full-stack developer living in Toronto who's passionate about building projects with real impact. I also build server-side utilities for the likes of system administration.

I have a personal website, with links to some people I know and other cool things. I'm also currently working on a rewrite which includes a better UI, light/dark mode switching, and an extensive portfolio. You can find the various domains for it below:
- https://imeesa.com
- https://eesa.lol
- https://iwillalways.win
- https://that.was-a.win
- https://ees4.dev

You can contact me via Discord [here](https://discord.com/users/845332948524859412) (if that link doesn't work, my Discord username is the same as my GitHub username) or by email [here](mailto:eesa@ees4.dev).

If you use Discord, you might want to check out my Discord server! It has a MOON tag with a purple moon icon.
